        2. How much of the task is covered by current AI tools like ChatGPT or Bing Copilot? (0 to 1 scale)
        3. What is the likely success rate for AI in performing or assisting with this task? (0 to 1 scale)
        4. How broad is the AI's impact on this type of task? Choose one: None, Minimal, Limited, Moderate, Significant, Complete
        5. Brief explanation for the above scores.
